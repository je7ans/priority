# Priority 

A library of generic priority queue implementations in Go

## Motivation

When Go announced [adding generics in v1.18](https://go.dev/blog/go1.18), I figured a good way to familiarize myself with the feature would be to implement some data structures. This would also help me brush up on these implementations and could even provide useful to devs looking for a third party solution :)
